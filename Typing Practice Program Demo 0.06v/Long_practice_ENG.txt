The Story of Snow White
One day, the Prince was riding through the forest 
looking for Snow White and found her.  
He leaned over and kissed her.  
She opened her eyes and sat up with a smile. Everyone was happy.  
The Prince took Snow White to his palace 
where they were married and lived happily ever after.

Silent Night Holy Night
Silent night, holy night, 
all is calm, all is bright 
round yon virgin 
mother and child. 
Holy infant, so tender and mild, 
sleep in heavenly peace,

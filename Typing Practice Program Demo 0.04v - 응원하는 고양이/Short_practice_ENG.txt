I'am a boy. You are a girl.
It's a beautiful night, 
Nice to meet you too.
It's so hard make the typing program.
Oh no Don't do that.
That's not OK now don't do that.
I think I wanna marry you.
I¡¯m in love with the shape of you .
A hot potato.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Cry over spilt milk.
Power is dangerous unless you have humility.
A good book is a great friend.
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
A drowning man will catch at a straw.
After a storm comes a calm.
A burnt childs dreads the fire.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
All is not gold that glitters.

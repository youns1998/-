The Selfish Giant 
Every afternoon,as they were coming from school, 
the children used to go and play in the Giant's 
garden. It was a large lovely garden, with soft 
green grass. Here and there over the grass 
stook beautiful flowers.

The Elves 
There was once a shoemaker, who, through no 
fault of his own, became so poor that at last 
he had nothing left but hust enough leather to 
make one pair of shoes. He cut out the shoes at 
night,so as to set to.
